The structure of your `README.md` for the project "Arachneia" looks quite decent, but there are a few areas that could be improved for clarity and professionalism. Here's a revised version with some suggestions:

---

# Arachneia

**Notice:** The executable file may trigger a warning from Windows Firewall. Please be assured it does not contain a virus.

This collection of scripts was originally created for personal use. However, if you find them helpful, feel free to use and enjoy them. Please note that these scripts are designed specifically for Windows.

## Not Supported
- MacOS and Linux are not currently supported.

## Planned/Added Features
- ☐ **Executable File**: Convert scripts into an executable file for ease of use by non-Python users.
- ☒ **Tabs**: Implement tabbed navigation for easier user interaction.
- ☒ **Dark Mode**: Introduce a dark mode option for users who prefer it.
- ☐ **Stop Button**: Add a feature allowing users to stop the script execution at any point.
- ☐ **Limiter**: Implement a limiter to prevent the program from freezing, ensuring that users can always interact with the stop button.
- ☐ **Progress Bar and Time Estimate**: Include a progress bar and an estimated time to completion for better user experience.

## Planned/Added Scripts
- ☐ **URL Extractor**: Extract URLs from text documents and identify their locations within your system.
- ☐ **Date Translator**: Translate dates to a month-first format for better organization in PC systems.
- ☐ **File Copy**: Copy a specific file structure, selecting only certain types of files.
- ☐ **File Date Adder**: Append dates to the front of folder names, based on a text document contained within the folder.
- ☐ **File Translator**: Convert files to different formats, such as converting WEBM to MP4 or MOV.

### Notes:
1. **Clear Section Headers**: It's good to have clear, concise section headers.
2. **Consistency in Formatting**: Use consistent formatting for lists and statuses (like planned/added features).
3. **Explanation of Purpose**: It might be helpful to add a brief section explaining what the scripts do or the goal of the project, for those who stumble upon it without prior knowledge.
4. **Spelling and Grammar**: Ensure that spelling and grammar are correct to present a professional appearance.

This is just a suggested structure and you may modify it as per your project's specific needs and your personal style.
